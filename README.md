# SquareBox-Full-Achieve
# !Warning this project is not yet completed or fully tested, it is still in active development, but has a lot of good content. 


This is my self-learning journey to a 2D game engine built in C++. 
Am using SDL for windowing, sound, and input
OpenGL for rendering
There are two folders in the achieve. 
Mobile has an MSVC solution for android development
SquareBox has the source code and a premake file for creating a desktop MSVC solution for the project.
I do not know how to configure premake to auto-generate the android solution so that's why I manually move the .sln file around because android development using Microsoft Visual Studio Code setup gives me a hard time.

Feel free to reach out if you have anything to say.
