# SquareBox-Full-Achieve
# !Warning this project is not yet completed or fully tested, it is still in active development , but has alot of good content. 


This is my self learning journey to a 2D game engine built in C++. 
Am using SDL for windowing , sound and input
Opengl for rendering
There are two folders in the achieve. 
Mobile has a MSVC solution for andriod development
SquareBox has the source code and a premake file for creating a desktop MSVC solution for the project.
I do not know how to configure premake to auto generate the andriod solution so thats why i manually move the .sln file around because andriod development using MicroSoft Visual Studio Code setup gives me a hard time.
